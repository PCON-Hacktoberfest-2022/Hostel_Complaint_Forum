# Hostel_Complaint_Forum
Through this project we are trying ease up the process of students filing complaints related to their
hostel like LAN issues, Water issues, Civil issues, Electrical and Other issues by developing an interactive
Android application. Students have to register themselves in the app using their institute email id then
only they can add their complain. The concerned department faculty will address the issue and update
the status of the steps taken by them in the app.
# Database
Firebase database is used in this app.
# Local Setup :
## 1. Fork the repository.
Fork this repository to your repository.

## 2. Clone the repository
For cloning this repository by using Git
**use this command :**
```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
```

## 3. Database connection
You can use my firebase database but you may not be able to see the database.
So you can also connect your Firebase database.

**For connecting your Firebase database follow this steps :**
```
> Go to your app file directory.
> Then delete `google-services.json` file.
> Open build.gradle file in android studio.
> Delete all the dependencies related to firesbase and sync it.
> Go to the Tools option in the toolbar and open Firebase.
> Look for Authentication or anything that you want to connect.
> Select connect to Firebase.
```

## Happy Coding 😊😎
